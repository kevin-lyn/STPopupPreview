                    - STPopupPreview uses long press gesture to enable quick preview of a page on non 3D Touch devices. Preview actions are also supported. This idea is inspired by Instagram.
                    - It is built on top of of STPopup(a library provides STPopupController, which works just like UINavigationController in popup style). Both STPopup and STPopupPreview support iOS 7+.
